# gifphay-ajax
This is gifphay API. The project is based on the gifphay API. 
## why gifphay in the project
I am using gifphay API to call any picture for any search. There are small piace for queryURl. The can search for any type of movies, songs or anythings they like to get images from gifphay website. once they click in the submmit button the search will be added to the list then after if user click on list they added to list it will get images for the seach from gifphay website through API call. 
if user double click on the images it will give you animated images for the search.
