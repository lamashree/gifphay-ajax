# gifphay-ajax:
This is gifphay API. The project is based on the gifphay API. 
## why gifphay in the project:
I am using gifphay API to call for choices for any search. There are small piace for queryURl. The can search for any type of movies, songs or anythings you like to get images from gifphay website. once they click in the submmit button the searched choice will be added to the list then after that if user click on choice they added to list it will get images for the choice from gifphay website through API call. 
if user double click on the images it will give you animated images for the choice. I am using [html](https://github.com/lamashree/gifphay-ajax/blob/master/index.html) to interact with user and javascript and jquery for manipulating DOM.
